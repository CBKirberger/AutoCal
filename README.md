# AutoCal
This repository stores all files pertaining to automated calibrations. Currently each folder contains all the files needed to run an automated calibration for the instrument 
denoted by the foler name. This should be amended slightly in the future so that the asset classes don't vary from procedure to procedure. 

Ideally we just create a python module that has all the instrument classes and make it downloadable through pip.
